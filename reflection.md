# Reflection Week 03

* **What I got right:** For the Week 02, my code compiled, so I can say that I did the code correctly.
* **What I got close/What I missed:** In Week 02, my version of code was slightly different than the solution version. I based it off "heapifyDown", so it ended up a little bit longer. The solution otherwise used one short piece of code "int index = last used position in underlying array;" that I believe is just the shorter version of "int child = this.usage - 1;".
* **What I learn by comparing my work and answers:** My code is longer and more detailed than the solution code, which is doing the same thing that it's shorter version, but I think shorter code can be cleaner and it's less work which is more time effective.
* **Was your code sufficiently documented with comments?** I think I added enough comments this time.
* **Did you test your code to verify that it compiles and returns correct results?** Yes, I tested it and it compiled.
